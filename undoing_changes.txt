Undoing Changes:

1)we add the changes but not commit it.
->git reset <file name> = to reset perticuler file 

2)we commit unwanted changes
->git reset HEAD~1 = back one Commit state (second last Commit state)

3)we can go Multiple step Commit
->git reset <Commit Hash> = we can go bach perticular Commit state (Commit hash -> git log)
->git reset --hard <Commit Hash> = changes are all remove from VS Code / Code editor
